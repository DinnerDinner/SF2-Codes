Exam Prep #3 – Solution


Descending order of Time Complexity (Worst Case)


Time Complexities (Worst Case):
- Selection Sort: O(n²)
- Insertion Sort: O(n²)
- Merge Sort: O(n log n)
- Quick Sort: O(n²) (in worst-case scenarios like sorted input without pivot optimization)
- Binary Search: O(log n)




a) Merge Sort > Quick Sort > Selection Sort > Insertion Sort > Binary Search  
b) Selection Sort = Insertion Sort = Quick Sort > Merge Sort > Binary Search  
c) Merge Sort = Quick Sort > Selection Sort = Insertion Sort > Binary Search  
d) Selection Sort > Merge Sort > Quick Sort > Insertion Sort > Binary Search  


Correct Order:
b) Selection Sort = Insertion Sort = Quick Sort > Merge Sort > Binary Search
