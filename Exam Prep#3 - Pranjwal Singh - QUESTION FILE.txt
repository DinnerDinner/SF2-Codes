Exam Prep #3 – Sorting/Searching: Time Complexity
Below are the common algorithms we’ve discussed in class:
1. Selection Sort  
2. Insertion Sort  
3. Merge Sort  
4. Quick Sort  
5. Binary Search  


Rank the above algorithms in descending order of time complexity (worst-case)*.  
Choose the correct option:


a) Merge Sort > Quick Sort > Selection Sort > Insertion Sort > Binary Search  
b) Selection Sort = Insertion Sort = Quick Sort > Merge Sort > Binary Search  
c) Merge Sort = Quick Sort > Selection Sort = Insertion Sort > Binary Search  
d) Selection Sort > Merge Sort > Quick Sort > Insertion Sort > Binary Search
